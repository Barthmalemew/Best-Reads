# Project Summary

## Overview of Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
The project is primarily developed using **Java**, leveraging the **Spring Boot** framework for building the backend services. The project also utilizes **Maven** as the build automation tool. The main libraries used include Spring Web for building web applications, Spring Data JPA for data access, and possibly others for various functionalities related to the backend services.

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the project appears to be the development of a backend application that manages a book logging system. It includes functionalities for handling books and logs, likely allowing users to add, retrieve, and manage their book-related data.

## List of Build/Configuration/Project Files
- **Build and Configuration Files:**
  - `/pom.xml` - Maven Project Object Model file for managing project dependencies and build configuration.
  - `/mvnw` - Maven Wrapper script for Unix-based systems.
  - `/mvnw.cmd` - Maven Wrapper script for Windows systems.

## Directories Containing Source Files
- Source files can be found in the following directory:
  - `/src/main/java/com/example/backend` - Contains the main Java source files for the backend application.
  
## Documentation Files Location
- Documentation files are located in the root directory:
  - `/README.md` - General project overview and instructions.
  - `/changelog.md` - Log of changes made to the project.
  - `/theDocument.md` - Additional documentation, specifics not defined in the provided structure. 

## Summary of Directory Structure
The project is organized into several key directories:
- **Source Code:** `/src/main/java/com/example/backend` (contains the Java classes for the backend application).
- **Resources:** `/src/main/resources` (contains configuration files and static resources like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
- **Database Files:** `/data` (contains database files for the book logging system).

This structure supports a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and develop the application further.
