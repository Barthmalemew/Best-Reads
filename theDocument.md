# How to Use a Changelog

## Overview
A **changelog** is a file that keeps a log of all notable changes made to a project. It is typically used to track project history, version updates, bug fixes, and new features. The most common format for a changelog is a **Markdown file** named `CHANGELOG.md`, placed in the root directory of the project.

The purpose of a changelog is to provide developers, users, and collaborators with a clear history of updates, making it easier to understand the evolution of the project.

## Basic Changelog Structure

A changelog is usually structured by version numbers, dates, and categories of changes. Here's a basic structure:

```markdown

# How to Use Spring Framework

## Overview
The **Spring Framework** is a comprehensive framework for building Java applications, enabling developers to write maintainable, scalable, and secure applications. This document provides a quick guide on how to get started and the core concepts of Spring.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. **Project Setup**
To set up a Spring project, you can follow the official guides for different build tools:
- [Spring Maven Setup](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/)
- [Spring Gradle Setup](https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/)

---

## Core Concepts

### 2. **Dependency Injection**
Spring's core feature is **Dependency Injection**. This allows Spring to manage dependencies between classes. Learn more about DI here:
- [Spring Dependency Injection](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-dependencies)

---

### 3. **Spring Configuration**
Spring can be configured using either **XML** or **Java**. Find more details on how to configure Spring here:
- [Spring XML Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-factory)
- [Spring Java Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-java)

---

### 4. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**
Spring's **AOP** allows you to manage cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transactions. More details can be found here:
- [Spring AOP Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#aop)

---

### 5. **Transaction Management**
Spring provides robust transaction management across various persistence technologies. More on Spring's transaction management:
- [Spring Transaction Management](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/data-access.html#transaction)
